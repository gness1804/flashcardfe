**Front End Interview Prep Mobile App**

![](http://g.recordit.co/yaxYXeiuHv.gif)

This app exists to help job seekers prepare for front end developer interviews. From the Home screen, you can select from three categories of questions: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These in turn are divided by category (typically difficulty). You can use this app to quiz yourself or others. Also, there is a section with links to useful interview-related sites and a section with questions to ask an interviewer. Good luck!

Pull requests are welcome! Make a pull request to this repo to add a question or a link or to add an update or correction to the information already existing in this app.

This app was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). Most of the info in the app comes from my colleague Lacey's [front end interview prep repo](https://github.com/lrknaff/frontend-interview-prep).

Tested on:
* Android (real Nexus5X and Nexus 9) using the [Expo app](https://expo.io/).
* iOS (virtual iPhone 6) using the [Expo XDE](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v15.0.0/introduction/installation.html).

I hope to distribute this app in the Google Play Store and Apple Store soon.
