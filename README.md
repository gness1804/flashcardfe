Front End Interview Prep Mobile App

This is a study app for front end technical interview questions written in React Native and bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). It consists of questions on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a flashcard-type format.

The information in this app is based on my colleague Lacey's [front end interview prep repo](https://github.com/lrknaff/frontend-interview-prep).

To submit questions, feel free to make a pull request!
